# Cook's Chocolates

## Proposal by Adam Cook

For my project, I would like to design a web page to provide different options
for people to select and choose a custom chocolate bar. In the future, I would
like to add a cart page, and have people be able to check out and buy the
chocolate, but for now I would just like to provide the user an option to select
and read about different types of chocolate bars.

People will interact with this website with a selection of drop  menus,
starting with type of chocolate (Dark, Light, milk, and white chocolate). Once
this selection is done, then I would like to upload the picture to match the
chosen selection. In order to do this, I will need to select a different image, or
stack additional photos to provide the current selection.

## Tasks

Some of the tasks that I will need to complete will include creating building
upon the template to add different options of selection. This will include the
addition of css to provide either a drop bar with the different options for
the bar, or an interactive table. In addition, I will need to figure out how to
update the picture to match that of the options selected.
For the main webpages, I need to update and add several articles with information
about the chocolate and its ingredients. I would like to create a short blog
with different topics, such as how the chocolate is sourced. The main page also
needs to be updated and laid out to fit the different photos and items.
