# Status Update by Adam Cook

Please follow the instructions in the assignment sheet as you write a status
update for the web design portfolio. This update should have two paragraphs
inside of it, with one paragraph explaining what you have already implemented
and the other the plan that you will follow to complete the project.

Already Implemented
So far I have implemented several things necessary for my final project. I needed
to add the different photos for each of the options, and I have now added photos
for all of the different options necessary for the chocolate bars.

Plan to Implement
Next, I will need to add a way for the person on the site to check the items into
a cart. This cart will need to allow the customer to select any object on the page
that they want to buy, and then process it. Once processed, the payment system
will need to call in for PayPal, or another system of payment.
