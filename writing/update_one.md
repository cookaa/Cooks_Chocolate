## Progres Thus Far & Problems Faced

Overall the project is going fairly well. I am making progress on on the layout and content for the site. I have added several photos that I will be using as the background to the homepage, a photo for the products that I wish to list. In addition, through looking over the example template I now understand much more about how the middlman template works. I have also updated one of the blogs that gives information about the chocolate. I need to continue updating and adding in the different pages to complete and start on the selection options. During my trip to Japan, I now know from looking that you can edit source code through the browser. This a great tool that I can potientally use, But also somewhat dangeruos. It is allowing me to edit and update this, but it will be difficult to use to write code due to the fact that I cannot use the gradle command to check my work for correctness.

## Upcoming 

In the future I would like to start planning implementing the store option for the webpage. With this, the users will be able to go through and individually select items that will be displayed. My current plan of approach is similar to that we discussed, with creating a drop down menu with the different options, or a table like that we created in our lab to show and select the different options. A large part of this project could be the addition of the select ability and creation of a custom image to reflect the selected options. This could be done in a number of ways, but my current plan is to approach it in a similar way to that of Dominos. They have a base image for their pizza, then depending on the toppings, it simply places them on top of the base image.
